Receive vertex data: Vertices, Triangles

For every triangle:
	calculate normals
	determine adjacent triangles - will share 2 out of 3 indices

Then:
	calculate edge normals by summing two adjacent triangle normals
	calculate edge tangents by taking cross product of the edge normal with the edge vector
			if the two neighboring triangles have teh same normals, option to turn off those triangles


Hold on:

	Paint a cylinder of radius eps to pass through each two adjacent vertices!!!!
